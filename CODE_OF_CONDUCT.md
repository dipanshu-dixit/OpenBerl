# Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

Project OpenBerl is building the universal protocol for AI interoperability. We're creating infrastructure that will outlast any single company or technology. This requires a community built on respect, collaboration, and shared purpose.

## Our Standards

**We encourage:**
- Constructive technical discussions
- Helping newcomers understand the protocol
- Building adapters that benefit everyone
- Sharing knowledge and best practices
- Focusing on the long-term vision

**We don't tolerate:**
- Personal attacks or harassment
- Discrimination of any kind
- Spam or self-promotion unrelated to the project
- Deliberately breaking others' work
- Gatekeeping or elitism

## Enforcement

Violations will result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the project. We want this to be a place where the best ideas win, regardless of who suggests them.

## Contact

Report issues to the project maintainers via GitHub issues with the `conduct` label.
